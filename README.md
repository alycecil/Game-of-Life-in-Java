Game-of-Life-in-Java
====================

This is a fork of ArturT's Game of Life in Java, which has had an Android UI wrapper built around it.

The wrapper uses on the fly image generation to render and delays to actually run the game.

I was inspired to write/mod this because I wondered what my github icon would do in Life.
